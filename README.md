# Politiquem

Web clients to display information about candidates in Brazil. That information is stored in [Check](https://meedan.com/check). There are two prototypes for that: [v1](https://ca.ios.ba/files/politiquem-v1/) and [v2](https://ca.ios.ba/files/politiquem-v2/). We're currently working on v2.

## TODO

* Replace dummy data about subjects by real data
* Add content for pages "Us" and "Partners"
* Choose a license
